* The employees set to retire make up an integral part of the company. 35% of those retiring are Senior Engineers, 35% are Senior Staff, and 13% are Engineers. 
* This percentage of senior level employees will require considerable mentorship and training to replace.

***Considerations Based on Analysis #2***

* Pewlett Hackard is in a unique position to make shifts in employment with both new hires and training of individuals moving into new roles as others retire. 
* The number of current Senior Staff remaining on is dramatically less than those retiring. This presents both challenges but also opportunities for the company. 
* If the company was considering making strategies decisions, now might be the time to consider as it develops new staff.

3. The data on the employees could include provide more insight that can facilitate mentorship possibilities. In reviewing the current data, the employees birth dates end at 1965. This could be all the data includes or all that was available at the time. Providing more information on employees born after this data may create a more accurate picture for the company.
